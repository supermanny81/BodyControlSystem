This system is designed to be used as a visual effects system for astromechs.  Sequences can be built by builders and uploaded to the R2FX system.  Other control systems can then integrate and call sequences or specific features using a serial connection, I2C or by connecting sequences to unused digital pins.

### Hardware _[..](#r2fx)_
Open source hardware and designed to recreate R2-D2's doors throughout the body using HS-55|65 servos with mini splines.  Original source files as well as STL exports are available to use for printing parts.

Using off the shelf hardware like an Arduino Uno, Adafruit PWM modules, and Bluefruit module, and FRAM chips.  You can control all of your astromechs dome panels, doors and more.
