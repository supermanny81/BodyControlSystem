This system is designed to be used as a visual effects system for astromechs.  Sequences can be built by builders and uploaded to the R2FX system.  Other control systems can then integrate and call sequences or specific features using a serial connection.

## Hardware 
Open source hardware and designed to recreate R2-D2's doors throughout the body using HS-55|65 servos with mini splines.
